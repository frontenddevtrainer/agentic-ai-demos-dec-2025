# AgenticAI Trainer: Core Notes

Agentic AI systems combine planning, tool-use, memory, and feedback loops to solve tasks. A practical agent has:

- A goal-driven planner (decomposition into steps)
- Tool execution with safety checks and retries
- Memory (short-term for conversation state; long-term for knowledge)
- Evaluation (self-critique, tests, or external metrics)

## LangGraph fundamentals

LangGraph models agents as state machines. You define a state, nodes that transform state, and edges that route between nodes. This allows:

- Deterministic control flow
- Conditional routing (e.g., only retrieve docs when needed)
- Iteration loops for planning and tool use

## RAG in agentic systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) adds knowledge from a vector store. In agentic flows, use RAG to:

- Ground answers with verified docs
- Provide citations and reduce hallucinations
- Update knowledge by re-ingesting documents

## Trainer guidelines

When training agentic AI practitioners:

- Emphasize data quality for KB documents
- Teach error analysis and observability
- Make the system safe by default (guardrails + topic filters)
