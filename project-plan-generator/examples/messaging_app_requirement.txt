Create a messaging app with sharing

The app should allow users to:
- Send and receive messages in real-time
- Create 1:1 and group conversations
- Share content from other apps into the messaging app
- Share messages and media from the app to other apps
- Forward messages within the app
- Send photos, videos, and files
- Search through message history
- Receive notifications for new messages
- Block and report users for safety
- Have user profiles with avatars and names

The app should be secure, performant, and accessible to all users.
