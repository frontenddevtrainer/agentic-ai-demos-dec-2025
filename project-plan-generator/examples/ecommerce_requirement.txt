Create an e-commerce platform for handmade crafts

The platform should allow:
- Sellers to create profiles and list their handmade products
- Buyers to browse products by category, search, and filter
- Shopping cart and checkout with multiple payment options
- Order tracking and history
- Product reviews and ratings
- Seller messaging for custom orders
- Wishlist and favorites
- Email notifications for orders and shipping
- Admin dashboard for managing sellers and products
- Mobile-responsive design

The platform should be secure (PCI compliance for payments), scalable to handle thousands of sellers, and provide a great user experience on all devices.
