Create a task management app for remote teams

The app should support:
- Creating and organizing tasks in projects and boards
- Assigning tasks to team members with due dates
- Real-time collaboration and updates
- File attachments and comments on tasks
- Task status tracking (todo, in progress, done, blocked)
- Calendar view and Kanban board view
- Time tracking for tasks
- Team activity feed and notifications
- Search and filtering across all tasks
- Integration with Slack and email
- Mobile apps for iOS and Android
- Guest access for external collaborators

The app should be fast, reliable, work offline with sync, and scale to support teams of 100+ members.
